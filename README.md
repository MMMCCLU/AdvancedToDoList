Scope:
	“For our project, we are not going to send a text to a phone due to those APIs not being free to use. Instead, our To-Do List will email the user and potentially update their Google Calendar as well. The general User Interface will have buttons to add an item to the list and buttons to remove items from the list when they are complete. Corresponding buttons for our APIs will exist.”

User Stories: 
    As a user I should be able to add an item to my to-do list so that I can remember things I need to do
    As a user I should be able to add my to-do list items to my Google Calendar so that I can keep everything in one place
    As a user I should be able to add all reminders to Gmail with one click so that I don't have to add each one manually
    As a user I should be able to choose what type of reminder I want so that I can make my reminders more effective.
    As a user I should be able to remove an item from the to-do list so that I can remove unwanted items 
    As a user I should be able to mark an item as done in the to-do list so that I can see what I have completed
    As a user I should be able to delete an entire list so that I can restart my items from scratch
    As a user I should be able to delete specific reminders so that i can remove unnecessary reminders
