Advanced To Do List<br />

Members:<br />

Scope:<br />
&emsp;“For our project, we are not going to send a text to a phone due to those APIs not being free to use. Instead, our To-Do List will email the user and potentially update their Google Calendar as well. The general User Interface will have buttons to add an item to the list and buttons to remove items from the list when they are complete. Corresponding buttons for our APIs will exist.”

API's Used:<br />
- Google Calender API
- GMAIL API
- Weather and Time API
